	The equalizer feature helps you to boost the bass, tweak treble, and more to tune your audio according to your taste. You can control your sound out like boost or lower frequency as you want. You can control your music volume, bass booster, and treble tweaking your music and amplifying your audio with the help of this feature. In simple words, It is a powerful tool for adjusting the sound of your song/music. You will be able correct the sound frequency and achieve the desired sound you want.

Real-Time or Auto-Sync Lyrics 
	The real-Time or Auto-Sync Lyrics feature is one of the most important feature. It displays scrolling lyrics with the phrase currently being sung in a song. Many people misheard lyrics so this feature helps them to know the correct lyric in real-time during playbacks.

Sleep Timer
Many of us love to listen to songs at our bedtime and fall asleep during listening to songs and forgot to turn off our music player app. Here, this Sleep Timer feature comes in use. You just have to select how long you want the music to play and set a time and this feature stops playing music at that particular time and helps you to sleep well without getting disturbed and helps to save your smartphone battery. 

Playlist
	This is a well-recognized feature that everyone knows about. It is a collection of your favorite songs or music you love to listen to all the time or very frequently.

Clean & Beautiful UI
	Don't know what is UI (User-Interface)? No worries, I will tell you. User -Interface is a method by which a user interacts with an app, website, software, etc. So who doesn't want beautiful and clean UI? It plays an important role and showing the quality or class of an app and helps the user to easily navigate, and browse features more easily. The more clean, beautiful, and stylish the UI is, the app is more easily understood and used. As per studies, Beautiful, Stylish, Clean, and Modern UI gives a soothing experience to the user and delivers peace of mind, and increase the engagement rate.

Bluetooth/Headset Control
	Bluetooth/Heatset Control is a must-have feature at the current time. With the help of this feature, you can pause, play, change, forward, and rewind the songs as well as control the volume of your music/songs. It helps you to control your music while wearing Bluetooth/Headsets without even touching or taking out your phone from your pocket.

Android Auto Compatibility
	In the car, Android Auto makes it simple to access your favorite music, media, and messaging apps. So if your music player app is compatible with Android Auto you can easily access play music/songs in your car from your music player app and enhance your music listening experience while driving. So it is also considered one of the most important point to choose a music player app for android.

Music Cutter/Ringtone Maker
	Music Cutter/Ringtone Maker is the most useful tool in a music player. Suppose you want to trim or edit any long introductory audiobook/music/podcasts or want to cut unwanted audio, with this tool you can cut, edit or trim them and save them as in ideal file formats. You can cut out songs and make ringtones of any song or music you want with the help of this powerful utility tool.

Album Arts Download
	I hate it when there are no or missing album arts in music files and it happens very often when you download songs online from websites to play them offline later. Album Arts download comes in use in this kinda situation. It helps you search and download album arts more easily and time-efficiently of a particular song or music.

Audio File Codec Support
	This is a very important and much-needed feature every music player app must-have. We all know there are many audio file formats like .mp3, .aac, .wav etc. All file formats have their pros and cons but it is more necessary for a music player to play all types of audio file formats very well without lagging, crashing, and compromising sound quality.

Playlist Backup & Restore
	Sometimes we accidentally deleted our playlist and it's very frustrating to make it again. To avoid this kind of situation, we require Playlist Backup and Restore feature. With the help of this feature, you can create a backup of your favorite music or songs playlists in your phone or local storage or cloud or wherever you want and easily restore it from there whenever you need it.

Playlist and Song Sharing
	The playlist and song sharing feature allows the user to share playlists and songs with their friends, family, relatives, etc. Users can easily share their favorite playlists and songs over WiFi, Infrared, Bluetooth, etc.

Multiple Language Support
	Multiple Language Support feature helps users to use the app in their local or regional language. It comes in use in a situation like someone who lives in China and doesn't know English or someone who likes in Russia and doesn't know Russian then this feature changes the app language and UI as per their preference or known language so they can also use it.

Customizable Themes or Skins
	Customizable themes or skin features allows user to personalize the appearance of the music player app as per their choices. Like you can change theme colors, upload your picture, and many more. This type of feature makes the app look more attractive and fun to use.

Last.FM Scrobbling 
	Those who listen to a lot of music should be using Last.FM. But, Many are not still familiar with the word Scrobbiling Last.FM, if you are one of them then, then don't worry I explain it to you, Scrobbling is the process of keeping track of the music you listen to via a third-party app. The word Scrobbling is most generally linked with submitting your listening history to Last.FM, however, there are a few other apps that do the same thing and help you discover new music and build your collection, as well as provide unique information as per your music genre, language, artist, and album preferences. This is one of the most useful and must-have tool feature in a music player app nowadays.

Widgets
	Widgets are an essential aspect of any music player app. Users can access and see information on the smartphone home screen or lock screen panel about the songs or music like Title, Artist, Album, Duration, Play, Pause, Next, Back, Forward, Rewind, etc. without opening the app. Users can move, drag, resize, the widget, and control the app directly from the widgets on the home screen or lock screen without opening the app.

Consume Less Memory
	It is one of the most important point to keep in mind for choosing the best music player, audio player, or media player app for your android smartphone or tablet. Music Player apps are generally not heavy-loaded apps they don't need lots of space and memory to run. The music player app must be small in size and consumes very less RAM. Lesser the RAM it consumes, the better the performance of the phone system and battery and gives you a lag-free music listening experience. 

Audiobooks and Podcasts Support
	Why do I say so!!! Because Life in today's world is quite fast. Not everybody has time to sit and read books. But now there is a solution to this problem as well. Now you can listen to podcasts and book summaries word by word while driving, jogging, resting, workout, etc with the help of audiobooks. You just need to download your favorite audiobook or podcasts on your phone and play it on the music player app anytime anywhere. So your music player app must support AudioBooks and Podcasts to do so.

Easy Search and Browse
	This is the most important feature above all. This feature allows the user to scan all files on the phone storage and organized them according to Artist, Albums, Genre, and Folder wise. It helps users quickly search and browse their favorite songs. 

Bonus Tip:
If you combine an advanced and strong video player like mx player or vlc player with a superior music player, it's the only must have all in one media player have on your android smartphone and tablet.
